webgl-engine
============
I am building a webgl rendering engine, only for my own use, and only really so I can learn how it all works.

If you want to use it, go for it, but please give me credit!

This is all my own code, with the exception of the matrix multiplication library (https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix), and jQuery (https://github.com/jquery/jquery).

At the moment this will only work with .obj files that are textured into a .mtl file.

I try to keep the most current working version demoed here: http://www.bracketbrotherhood.com/webgl-engine/public/ if you fancy a look at it.
